## Bio

I'm a social worker who enjoys creative problem-solving and community-based approaches to data analysis and research.  Outside of social work, my interests include learning, spending time outdoors, and playing music.

## Experience

For most of the last decade, I have worked in data and quality-related roles related to child and family well-being, juvenile justice, mental health services, and housing.  Prior to my data-related roles, I provided mental health, substance use, and conflict resolution services to youth, families, and adults in residential and community-based settings.
